# 📄 FIFA World Cup EDA (1930–2022)
## 📚 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of FIFA World Cup data using three datasets:

- matches.csv

world_cup.csv

world_rankings.csv

The aim of the analysis is to understand patterns, trends, team performances, and interesting historical facts from the FIFA World Cups held between 1930 and 2022.

## 🗂️ Datasets Description
matches.csv

Contains detailed information about every FIFA World Cup match from 1930 to 2022.

Columns include: participating teams, match results, stage (group stage, final, etc.), goals scored, and more.

world_cup.csv

Provides a summary of each FIFA World Cup tournament.

Columns include: year, host country, champions, runner-up, number of matches, goals scored, and attendance figures.

world_rankings.csv

Displays the FIFA rankings of national teams.

Columns include: team name, current rank, previous rank, total points, and rank change over time.

## 🔍 EDA Highlights
Participation Analysis
Created a heatmap showing which teams participated in each World Cup year.
Observations include:

Consistent qualifiers like Brazil, Germany, Argentina, France, and Italy.

Political changes reflected in team names (e.g., West Germany, East Germany, Germany after reunification).

Newer teams appearing in recent years (e.g., Qatar, Iceland, Bosnia).

Historical Evolution

Studied how political transitions (e.g., Yugoslavia, Soviet Union) affected team representation.

Noticed name changes and country splits over decades.

Performance Trends

Analyzed champions and runner-up patterns across decades.

Noted gaps where even strong teams missed qualification (e.g., Italy 2018, France 1994).

Ranking Analysis

Compared team performances with their FIFA rankings.

Observed ranking changes and trends among top-performing countries.

## 📈 Tools and Libraries Used

## 📝 Key Takeaways
Some teams have dominated historically, while others have risen recently.

Political history and global events (e.g., country splits, reunifications) directly influenced World Cup team entries.

Rankings generally correlate with performance, but surprises (upsets) are common.

World Cup hosting often boosts participation and visibility of new countries.

##🚀 Future Work
Perform predictive modeling to forecast future World Cup champions.

Deeper sentiment analysis of matches using commentary data (if available).

Compare World Cup performance with team FIFA rankings trends over time.
